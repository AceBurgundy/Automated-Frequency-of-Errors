# Automated Frequency of Errors

This is a simple web application that provides an Excel-like interface for creating and managing tabular data. Users can add rows, set a frequency value, and save the table as a CSV file.
Features

    Add Row: Clicking the "Add Row" button adds a new row to the table. Each row contains cells where users can enter data.

    Set Frequency: Users can set a frequency value by entering a number in the frequency input field and clicking the "Set Frequency" button. This frequency value is used for calculations in the app.

    Data Input and Calculation: Clicking on a data container cell in the table allows users to enter data. The app performs calculations based on the entered data and the frequency value. The calculated results are displayed in the corresponding data receiver cells.

    Save As CSV: The app allows users to save the table as a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. Clicking the "Save As CSV" button generates a CSV file containing the table data. The file is then downloaded to the user's device.

## Usage

    To set a frequency value, enter a number in the frequency input field and click the "Set Frequency" button.

    Click on any data container cell in the table to enter data. The app will calculate and display the results in the corresponding data receiver cells.
